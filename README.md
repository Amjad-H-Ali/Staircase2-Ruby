# Staircase2-Ruby


##### This repository assumes you have already viewed [Recursive-Staircase-Ruby](https://github.com/Amjad-H-Ali/Recursive-Staircase-Ruby).

### We will take the program a step further.

#####  Instead of the program only computing the answer for max of 2 steps, configure the program to compute the number of ways to reach the top of a staircase with a given varible, _max_, which will represent the maximum amount of steps that can be taken at one time.

#### Example:

##### If _max_ is _3_, the steps that can be taken at one time to climb the staircase is _3_.

##### If _steps_ equals 3 (the staircase contains 3 steps), then the number of ways to reach the top is 4.

#### As in:

##### From step 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 or

##### step 0 to 1 to 3 or

##### step 0 to 2 to 3 or 

##### step 0 to 3.

##### Thus, the output equals 4.
